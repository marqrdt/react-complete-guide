Coide for the React Complete Guide Udemy course by Maximillian Schwarzmuller

## Purpose for this repository

This repo contains the code for Maximillian Schwarzmuller's excellent "React Complete Guide" course on Udemy. I highly recommend his courses.
I am not just copying in the completed code for this course, but updating it as I progress, adding my own comments and altering the code to suit my style.
